Goals:
 - Create an app that records and stores coupons
 - Use Yelp/Google Maps API
 - Allow shareable coupons and groups

User will input the following:
- Name of company
- Deal
- Location (e.g. only available at)
- Expiration Date
- Pax (# of people who can be included in one coupon, e.g. family deal = 4)
- Description (any exceptions or specifics)
- Coupon reference code (if applicable)


Other Ideas:
- Yelp/Google Maps API
- Customer Review
- Share to FB
- Scan QR code
- Filter/Search coupons
- Introduce group feature (allows friends/strangers to hop in on a bundle deal)
- allow companies to advertise through our app (monetization)
